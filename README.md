# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

This Project analysis consists of:

 - Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
 - Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
 - Optimize the Model


## Results

* Data Preprocessing:
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
